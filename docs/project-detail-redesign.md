Project Detail Page Redesign Documentation

Overview

This redesign improves the Project Detail page for both crowdfunding projects and hackathon submissions.
The objective is to create a simpler, clearer, and more professional experience by improving layout structure, visual hierarchy, and interaction flow. The redesign focuses on clarity of primary actions (Vote / Back), improved content readability, and consistent behavior across desktop and mobile.

Design Principles
* Clear primary action above the fold
* Strong visual hierarchy
* Reduced visual noise
* Consistent spacing and typography
* Intentional use of the green accent
* Professional and trustworthy product feel

---

Layout Structure

Desktop
Left: Sticky summary sidebar
* Project logo
* Title
* Status and short description
* Progress (votes/funding where applicable)
* Primary CTA (Vote or Back)
* Secondary actions (Share)
* Creator info and external links

Right: Main content area
* Horizontal tab navigation
* Dynamic tab content
* Optimized reading width for long-form content

> The sidebar remains visible while scrolling to maintain action visibility and improve engagement.

Mobile
* Sidebar collapses into a condensed header block
* Horizontal scrollable tab navigation
* Single-column content layout
* Primary CTA positioned prominently without overwhelming the interface

> No feature loss between desktop and mobile.

---

Component Redesign
1. Loading State
A simplified skeleton layout that mirrors final structure:
* Sidebar placeholder block
* Tab row skeleton
* Content block placeholders
* Reduced visual motion for a clean, professional feel

> The loading state communicates layout structure without clutter.

---

2. Sidebar (Desktop) / Header Block (Mobile)
Improvements:
* Strong title hierarchy
* Short description positioned clearly under title
* Simplified progress visualization
* One clearly emphasized primary action
* Secondary actions styled with lower visual weight
* Creator avatar and name placed below primary CTA
* External links grouped and visually subtle

> The goal is clarity and action focus.

---

3. Tab Bar
Tabs: Details, Team, Milestones, Voters (optional), Backers (optional), Comments
Improvements:
* Clear selected state
* Subtle hover state
* Consistent spacing and typography
* Scrollable on mobile
* Optional tabs hidden gracefully when not applicable

> The tab system is visually lightweight but structurally strong.

---

Tab-Level Redesign
Details Tab
* Controlled reading width for markdown content
* Clear heading hierarchy
* Improved paragraph spacing
* Links styled consistently
* Optional media block positioned after introduction
* Improved vertical rhythm

> Focus: readability and professional presentation.

Team Tab
* Grid layout on desktop
* Vertical list on mobile
* Avatar, name, and role hierarchy clearly defined
* Clean spacing between members

Empty State Example:
> No team members yet. This project is currently solo.

Milestones Tab
* Vertical timeline layout
* Status indicators (Upcoming, Active, Completed)
* Clean separation between stages
* Optional filter alignment

Empty State Example:
> No milestones have been added yet.

Voters Tab
* Clean list layout
* Vote indicators clearly distinguished
* Sorting control aligned with header

Empty State Example:
> No votes yet. Be the first to support this project.

Backers Tab
* Supporter card or structured list layout
* Clear contribution display
* Encouraging but subtle empty state

Empty State Example:
> Be the first to back this project.

Comments Tab
* Structured threaded layout
* Controlled indentation depth
* Clear reply visibility
* Sorting dropdown aligned to section header
* Clean comment input field with clear submit action

Empty State Example:
> No comments yet. Start the discussion.

Empty State Strategy
Each tab includes a purposeful empty state to avoid dead screens:
* Encourage action
* Maintain tone consistency
* Support engagement goals

---

Error State Strategy
Each tab and interactive component must handle failures gracefully to maintain clarity, trust, and engagement.

General Principles
* Display a clear, concise error message in context
* Offer a retry action when appropriate
* Maintain the same layout structure as loading and empty states
* Keep messaging professional and consistent with tone

Tab-Level Examples
Details / Team / Milestones / Voters / Backers / Comments Tabs
  * Error message: “Something went wrong while loading this content.”
  * Retry CTA: “Try again” button positioned centrally within the tab content area
  * Maintain spacing and typography consistency with other states

Comment Submission Failure
  * Inline error: “Your comment could not be submitted.”
  * Preserve typed input so users don’t lose their content
  * Include a retry button adjacent to the input field

 Vote / Back Action Failure
  * Inline or toast notification: “Your vote could not be recorded.”
  * Provide immediate retry option
  * Ensure visual distinction from primary actions to avoid confusion

Deliverables for Implementation
* Error-state mockups for all tabs and key actions
* Retry interaction designs and user flow diagrams
* Copy for all error messages and notifications

---

UX Improvements
* Single primary CTA above the fold
* Sticky action area improves conversion
* Stronger reading experience
* Consistent spacing system
* Clear separation of primary vs secondary actions
* Reduced cognitive load

---

Visual System Adjustments
* Reduced shadow usage
* Controlled border radius for consistency
* Green accent reserved primarily for key actions and highlights
* Improved typography hierarchy
* Balanced whitespace for clarity

> The page now feels lighter, more modern, and more trustworthy.

---

Responsiveness Strategy
* Sidebar collapses into header on smaller screens
* Horizontal tab scroll
* Content reflows naturally
* No feature disparity between device sizes

---

Deliverables
* Desktop full-page mockups (all tabs)
* Mobile full-page mockups (all tabs)
* Component-level breakdown
* Loading, empty, and error state designs
* Retry interaction and UX flow documentation
* UX recommendations
